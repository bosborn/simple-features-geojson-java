### About ###

[Simple Features GeoJSON](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-geojson-java/) is a Java library for writing and reading [Simple Feature](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-java) Geometries to and from GeoJSON.

### Usage ###

View the latest [Javadoc](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-geojson-java/docs/api/)

#### Read ####

```java

//String content = ...    

Geometry geometry = FeatureConverter.toGeometry(content);
mil.nga.sf.Geometry simpleGeometry = geometry.getGeometry();

/* Read as a generic GeoJSON object, Feature, or Feature Collection */
//GeoJsonObject geoJsonObject = FeatureConverter.toGeoJsonObject(content);
//Feature feature = FeatureConverter.toFeature(content);
//FeatureCollection featureCollection = FeatureConverter.toFeatureCollection(content);

```

#### Write ####

```java

//Geometry geometry = ...

String content = FeatureConverter.toStringValue(geometry);

Feature feature = FeatureConverter.toFeature(geometry);
String featureContent = FeatureConverter.toStringValue(feature);

FeatureCollection featureCollection = FeatureConverter.toFeatureCollection(geometry);
String featureCollectionContent = FeatureConverter.toStringValue(featureCollection);

Map<String, Object> contentMap = FeatureConverter.toMap(geometry);

```
